- create a cli to allow to you to play a game
- There needs to be a grid which will be our Map of any size
- The Player's goal is to reach the top right, starting at the bottom left
- The player can move up, down, left, or right (but not off the Map)
- Each move there's a small chance for either an Enemy or an Item to spawn at that spot
- If an Item , the stats get added automatically to the Player permanently along with some text to show what it is 
- If an Enemy, the player will fight the Enemy until one of them runs out of Hp. The player permanently loses any HP lost during the fight. Dame = Attack - Defense
- The player wins the game if they reach the goal in the top right and loses if they lose all their HP before they reaching the goal
